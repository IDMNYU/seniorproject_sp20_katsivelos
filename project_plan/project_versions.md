# Project Versions

Alpha, Beta, and Gold refer to a projectâ€™s life cycle. The specific parameters and expectations of each version will be individually determined in consultation with the professor.

* **Alpha** is the testing phase of form and functionality for your project.
* **Beta** is when the functionality, form, and implementation of your project is complete as possible. It is ready for user testing.
* **Gold** is when all the bugs in your project have been fixed and quality is assured. It is ready to go public.

## FEEDBACK THROUGH USER TESTING

You should be conducting research and user testing throughout the ENTIRE semester. Do not wait until the last minute to begin user testing; User testing gives you invaluable feedback about your project.
