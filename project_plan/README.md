# Project Plan

![Forget Perfect. Make Progress!](http://teaching.polishedsolid.com/images/gettoworkbook_forget_perfect.png) 

_Illustration by Jolby from gettoworkbook_

The project plan will consist of a presentation and a written proposal.

This project plan will be constantly iterated over the course of the semester. It may grow and/or shrink over the course of the semester. Don't worry about "getting it right." The creative process is messy.

Please remember that you and a classmate can work as a team. Only one presentation and proposal is to be submitted per team.

* Please name your file as lastname\_senior\_sp20\_projectplandraft\#\_date.pdf \(i.e. duff\_senior\_sp20\_projectplan1\_2016jan15.pdf\). If a team, put both of your last names \(i.e. duff\_and\_dubois\)
* Please note that any significant changes to your project will require the submission of a revised project plan.
* Upload drafts to a folder labeled _project plan_ in your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](../end_of_semester_deliverables/).

            However, it is not required if you have another system with prioritization
            as a focus. If you have another system, you must share it with the instructor.</li>
          <li>All actionable tasks should start with a verb (i.e. write, call, email,
            build, code, collect, etc.), and can be completed in a day.</li>
          <li>Also be specific with your tasks. (For example, &quot;take 20 photographs&quot;
            is more explicit than &quot;take photographs&quot;. &quot;Take 5 photos
            of tigers, 5 photos of bears, 5 photos of lizards, and 5 photos of cats&quot;
