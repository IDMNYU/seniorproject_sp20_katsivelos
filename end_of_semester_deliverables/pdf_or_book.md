# Process pdf or book

This should be compiled using **Adobe InDesign**.

I would use the [project plan](../project_plan/) _as a guideline_ for the structure of this pdf or book, and your process website, project demos, and project presentations for content. This pdf or book should illustrate and describe your project process over the course of the semester. Include details of how you did research, design, prototyping, and development. Also discuss how your project changed directions along the way and what you learned over the course of the semester. Include descriptions and images of your project at various stages \(prototypes and versions\) and an image of your final project. You should also consider layout and design elements of the pdf or book.

Upload all drafts including the final version to a folder labeled _end of semester pdf \(or book\)_ in your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](./).

### First and Second Drafts

* Please name your file as lastname\_senior\_sp20\_draft\#\_date.pdf \(i.e. duff\_senior\_sp20\_draft1\_2020apr15.pdf and duff\_senior\_sp20\_draft2\_2020may08.pdf\)

### Final Version

* Please name your file as lastname\_senior\_sp20.pdf \(i.e. duff\_senior\_sp20.pdf\) 
* If pdf, **post on slack** for everyone to see and download in the class
* If physical book, post the link to the preview on blurb on slack AND bring the actual book. Make sure the book is public and that you can preview the entire book. If you can't figure out how to preview it on blurb, upload a pdf of the book to the senior project channel on slack.

This should be compiled using **Adobe InDesign**.

PDF Cover:

* Your first and last name \(if team, both names\)
* The Name of Your Project

Combine multiple pdfs using Adobe Acrobat Pro: FILE &gt; CREATE &gt; COMBINE INTO A SINGLE PDF or using Preview \(Drag and Drop with thumbnail panel\)

## \(OPTIONAL instead of PDF\) END OF SEMESTER BOOK REQUIREMENTS

See the end of semester pdf requirements above and adopt them in book format instead IF YOU WANT EXTRA CREDIT.

I highly suggest blurb

* [Blurb Formats and Pricing](http://www.blurb.com/create/book/pricing#color-pocket) \(Shipping isn't included in these costs\)
* I recommend the [Magazine format](http://www.blurb.com/pricing#magazines). It's the cheapest.
* **Shipping is 7 to 10 business days** \(KEEP THIS IN MIND!\)
* Also check for blurb [coupons](https://www.blurb.com/coupon-codes)
